#summary Steps to generate timelapse

= Main principle =

== First : project environment configuration ==

- set up eclipse/java timelapse-darktable environment following wiki steps

- be sure that you have the dependencies:

/usr/bin/darktable-cli

/usr/bin/mencoder


== Then : Generate your timelapse ==

1. define key frames of your future timelapse:

- In darktable modify keyframe pictures

- Copy corresponding XMP files in a "xmpRef" folder for instance

- the "xmpRef" folder contains definition of key frames to interpolate for the whole timelapse

practically: tune all parameters you want in darktables filters.
then copy/paste all parameters in darktable to desired key frames of your timelapse.
Tune these keyframes without adding/removing filters, just change tuning in filters.
Select XMP files of keyframes > copy them into a xmp source folder to be interpolated


2. clean up your output_folder (where files will be stored)

if this step is not done, some file will be duplicated and you will get some strange results.

You can also specify a new folder name (not existing yet)

3. launch Main.java with 3 (or 4/5) arguments:

raw_source_folder xmp_source_interp output_folder (size optional)

note:

  * in eclipse by configuring arguments tab in Run > Run configurations...

  * with exported JAR by adding arguments after java -jar 
java -jar timelapse-dartable.jar "rawImg" "xmpKeys" "out" 

4. go to output_folder and watch your timelapse : video.avi !

The timelapse video is done from interpolated frames generated with darktable-cli and interpolated XMP files !!! :-)
