#summary Steps to generate timelapse

= Main principle =

- generate few XMP "source" to interpolate with darktable

practically: tune all parameters you want in darktables filters.
then copy/paste all parameters in darktable to desired key frames of your timelapse.
Tune these keyframes without adding/removing filters, just change tuning in filters.
Select XMP files of keyframes > copy them into a xmp_source_interp folder

- set up eclipse/java timelapse-darktable environment folowwing wiki steps

- create output_folder (where files will be stored)

- launch Main.java in eclipse with arguments:
raw_source_folder xmp_source_interp output_folder (size optional)

Warning : you should have created output_folder before launching Main.java

- go to output_folder
launch generateDarktableTimelapse.sh:
>> . generateDarktableTimelapse.sh


You have your interpolated frames generated with darktable-cli and interpolated XMP files !!! :-)
