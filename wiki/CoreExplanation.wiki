#summary Explanation of the timelapse processing

= Main steps =

timelapse-darktable allows to treat a series of photo easily.
The main steps of the global processing are listed by order:

  # load XMP from keyframe reference folder (e.g. shots {10 50 100}).
  # interpolate keyframes XMP filters values for the whole series. (e.g. 10 11 12 ... 98 99 100})
  # export JPG from interpolated XMP file and source image of the source image folder for the whole series
  # compute the luminance curve of the series (external call: convert)
  # filter the luminance curve for deflickering target (external call: octave)
  # calibrate the luminance sensitivity of the scene
  # apply deflickering target through darktable exposure module and save it in XMP
  # export the series in JPG with new XMP for the whole series
  # produce timelapse movie from the JPG series (external call: ffmpeg)
