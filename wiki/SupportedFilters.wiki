= Introduction =

This page makes the list of dartkable supported filters in timelapse-darktable.

Use only these filters in your darktable treatment for your timelapse.

Or implement (or ask to implement) a new one :-)

If you have a java exception error in a "read" operation, it should be because of an unsupported filter (not implemented or not the same darktable version).

= List of supported filters (IOP) =

  * Atrous.class,
  * Basecurve.class,
  * Clipping.class,
  * Colorzones.class,
  * Denoiseprofile.class,
  * Exposure.class,
  * Graduatednd.class,
  * Hotpixels.class,
  * Levels.class,
  * Shadhi.class,
  * Sharpen.class,
  * Temperature.class,
  * Velvia.class,
  * Vibrance.class,

(for now versions for darktable 1.2.3 are implemented)

NB: Atrous.class means "atrous" filter of darktable
